# 🛍️ AJIO Web E-Commerce Purchase Flow – End-to-End QA Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world QA implementation for an e-commerce web application inspired by AJIO.  
The goal was to design, plan, and execute a structured testing strategy using Agile methodology.

The project covers complete purchase flow validation from user registration to add-to-cart and beyond.

---

## 📝 Test Artifacts Created

- Requirements Documentation
- Epics & User Stories
- Acceptance Criteria
- Test Scenarios
- Detailed Test Cases
- Defect Reports
- Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)
  - User Story based
  - Acceptance Criteria based
- Test Summary Report
- Exploratory Testing Notes

---

## 🐞 Defect Management

- Defects logged with:
  - Severity & Priority
  - Steps to Reproduce
  - Expected vs Actual Result
  - Status Tracking
- Simulated complete bug lifecycle workflow

---

## 🔗 Traceability

Maintained complete traceability:
Requirement → User Story → Acceptance Criteria → Test Scenario → Test Case → Defect

This ensures full coverage visibility and impact analysis.

---

## 🧪 Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Test Documentation & RTM)
- Jira (Scrum Simulation & Bug Workflow – Portfolio Purpose)
- Browser Developer Tools
- Chrome Web Browser

---

## 📈 Key Learnings

- Requirement breakdown & coverage strategy
- Designing scalable test documentation
- Understanding business logic behind e-commerce flows
- Traceability management
- Risk identification
- Structured bug reporting
- Thinking beyond happy paths

## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

Unlike small demo testing exercises, this project simulates a structured QA workflow in an Agile environment with traceability, sprint planning, and coverage strategy.

It demonstrates readiness for entry-level QA roles in Manual + Hybrid environments.
