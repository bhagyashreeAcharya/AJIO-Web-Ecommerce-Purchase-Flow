# BUG-001 – Invalid Lower Boundary Mobile Number Accepted at Authentication Entry Point

## Bug Details
- **Bug ID:** BUG-001
- **Module:** Authentication Entry Point / Mobile Number Validation
- **Project:** AJIO Web – E-commerce Purchase Flow (Portfolio Project)

## Description
The system accepts an invalid Indian mobile number below the defined lower boundary and allows the user to proceed without displaying any validation message. As a result, the user is incorrectly routed to the Registration screen. As per the acceptance criteria, only 10-digit mobile numbers starting with digits 6–9 are considered valid.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Enter the mobile number **5999999999** on the mobile number entry screen
2. Click on **Continue**

## Expected Result

## Actual Result
- No validation message is displayed
- User is allowed to proceed to the Registration screen

## Severity
