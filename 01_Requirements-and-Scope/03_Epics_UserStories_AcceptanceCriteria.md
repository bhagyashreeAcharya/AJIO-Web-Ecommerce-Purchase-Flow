# Epics, User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

This file documents the structured requirement breakdown for the AJIO Web Purchase Flow project.

## Purpose

This document represents Phase 1 – Test Analysis & Requirement Structuring.

It includes:

- Epic definition based on business modules
- User Stories aligned with functional scope
- Acceptance Criteria written in Given–When–Then format
- Clear scoping boundaries before test design began

## Why Separate Excel?

The structured Excel format was chosen to:

- Maintain clear traceability between Epic → User Story → AC
- Enable mapping with RTM
- Support scalable coverage tracking
- Avoid cluttering markdown with large tabular data

## How It Connects

This document feeds directly into:

- Test Case Design
- Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)
- Execution Coverage Analysis

---

This represents the requirement baseline used before test case creation began.
